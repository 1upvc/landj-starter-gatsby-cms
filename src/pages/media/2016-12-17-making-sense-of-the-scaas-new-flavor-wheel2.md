Snack makers are catering to this demographic by turning out better-for-you versions of those familiar goodies. Consumers are picking up vegan and gluten-free MadeGood crispy squares instead of Rice Krispies Treats, Tree Hugger vegan, nut- and dairy-free lollipops rather than Charm Blow Pops, and Annie's Organic Cheddar Bunnies with real cheese in place of Goldfish snacks.

According to a recent CivicScience survey of 772 parents with kids between 3 and 17 years cited by The Journal, almost 40% allow their children to consume junk food several times per week. And that's regardless of the industry's growing emphasis on healthier products, cleaner labels and transparency in food and beverage manufacturing.
