  On the road from Bangalore to Mysore in South India there is a town called Maddur.  Here they make "vadas" or fritters of all sizes and variations.  Inspired by this and modern age needs, we infused our own cooking style with a theme of spicy yet sweet and came up with our family recipe.  Our all natural fritter with great ingredients is made without any additives and is proudly Made in the USA.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
