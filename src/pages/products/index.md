        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

      The crunchy outside yet soft inside is a great touch especially with the chilis.  They sneak up on you in the most happy and pleasant manner.
