heading: Our fritter with a bit of a kick
description: >-
  On the road from Bangalore to Mysore in South India there is a town called Maddur.  Here they make "vadas" or fritters of all sizes and variations.  Inspired by this and modern age needs, we infused our own cooking style and came up with our family recipe.  Our all natural fritter with great ingredients is made without any additives and is Made in the USA.

    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
