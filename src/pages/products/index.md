description: >-
  On the road from Bangalore to Mysore in South India there is a town called Maddur.  Here they make "vadas" or fritters of all sizes and variations.  Inspired by this and modern age needs, we infused our own cooking style with a theme of spicy yet sweet and came up with our family recipe.  Our all natural fritter with great ingredients is made without any additives and is proudly Made in the USA.

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
