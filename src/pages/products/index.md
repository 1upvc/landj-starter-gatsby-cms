        Origin: On the road to Bangalore to Mysore, there is a small town of Maddur off the expressway.  Here they make "Maddur Vadas" - fritters that are off all shapes, sizes, ingredients, and proportions.  Our family recipe was inspired by this small town and then optimized for the modern age consumption.

      The crunchy outside yet soft inside is a great touch especially with the chilis.  They sneak up on you in the most happy and pleasant manner.
