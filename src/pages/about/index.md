### Family Venture
L&J Family Foods is a family venture, started by a mother (Latha) and her son (Junie) to simply explore if a family fritter recipe and other lovable snacks could be put on a store shelf.  The mother told her son, "if you figure out and convince a store for shelf space, I'll teach you how to make it."

Through the joy of cooking together as a family, we have a goal of bringing delicious ethnic naturally made family snacks recipes to a modern age.  Inspired natural recipes, have vegan and/or gluten free focus, and are intended to bring joy and relief to the stresses of everyday life. The recipes and cooking techniques were passed in the best way possible: from mother to son with love.
