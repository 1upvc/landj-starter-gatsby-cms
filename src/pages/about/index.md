title: About L&J Foods

### Origin
L&J Family Foods was started by a mother and her son to simply explore if a family recipe for a fritter could be put on a shelf.  The mother told her son, "if you figure out how to get it on a shelf, I'll teach you how to make it." Through the joy of cooking together, we have a goal of bringing delicious ethnic family snacks recipes to a naturally focused modern age.  These recipes have all have a human focus and are intended to bring joy and relief to the stresses of everyday life. They were passed in the best way possible: from mother to son with love.
